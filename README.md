# Saturn-V

A CSS Framework made to launch web apps.
 
## Just CSS

Saturn-V is just CSS, no JS, jQuery or any other JavaScript Framework.

## Architecture
Hybrid Architecture; the best parts of the SMACSS, BEM and ITCSS that work for us.

## Why another CSS Framework?

Bootstrap, Foundation and Material frameworks represent their creators opinions and ideology, they are great, but biased and all of them do more that we need. 

Saturn-V do less, solve our problems and maybe can help you to solve yours.
